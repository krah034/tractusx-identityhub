# Local Development with Docker Compose

This directory provides a Docker Compose setup for running all four runtime variants
of tractusx-identityhub locally without requiring Minikube or Helm.

Two **profiles** are available:

| Profile | Services started | Use when |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `memory` | `identityhub-memory`, `issuerservice-memory` | Fastest dev loop; no external dependencies |
| `sql` | `identityhub`, `issuerservice`, `postgres`, `vault` | Full stack with PostgreSQL + HashiCorp Vault |

> **Note:** The `memory` and `sql` profiles share the same host ports (e.g. `8181`, `8182`,
> `7171`, `7172`) and therefore **cannot be run simultaneously**. Stop one profile
> (`docker compose --profile <name> down`) before starting the other.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Compose v2 (`docker compose version` ≥ 2.14)
- JDK 21+ and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (or use the wrapper `./gradlew`)

---

## Step 1 — Build the runtime JARs

Run from the **repository root**:

```shell
./gradlew shadowJar
```

This produces all four JARs under their respective `runtimes/*/build/libs/` directories and
also processes resources (including `logging.properties`) required by the Docker build.

---

## Step 2 — Configure environment variables (optional)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside this directory and adjust values if needed:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

The defaults (`postgres`/`postgres` credentials, Vault token `token`) work out of the box.

---

## Step 3 — Start the services

### Memory profile (no database, no Vault)

```shell
# Run from this directory (deployment/docker/)
docker compose --profile memory up -d --build
```

### SQL profile (PostgreSQL + HashiCorp Vault)

```shell
docker compose --profile sql up -d --build
```

> **Notes:**
> - The `--build` flag is only needed on the first run or after rebuilding the JARs.
>   Subsequent starts can omit it: `docker compose --profile memory up -d`.
> - The `-d` flag runs containers in detached mode. Omit it to see logs streamed in the
>   foreground; use `docker compose --profile <name> logs -f` to follow logs when detached.

## Port reference

### identityhub / identityhub-memory

| Endpoint | Host port | Container port | Path |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------|
| Default API | 8181 | 8181 | `/api` |
| Version | 7171 | 7171 | `/.well-known/api` |
| Credentials API | 13131 | 13131 | `/api/credentials` |
| DID | 10100 | 10100 | `/` |
| Identity API | 15151 | 15151 | `/api/identity` |
| STS | 9292 | 9292 | `/api/sts` |

### issuerservice / issuerservice-memory

Within a single profile both runtimes start side-by-side, so the issuerservice host ports
that would otherwise conflict with identityhub are offset by one (e.g. `8182` instead of `8181`).
Container-internal ports remain identical for both runtimes.

| Endpoint | Host port | Container port | Path |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------|
| Default API | 8182 | 8181 | `/api` |
| Version | 7172 | 7171 | `/.well-known/api` |
| Issuance API | 13132 | 13132 | `/api/issuance` |
| DID | 10101 | 10100 | `/` |
| Identity API | 15251 | 15151 | `/api/identity` |
| Issuer Admin API | 15152 | 15152 | `/api/issuer` |
| STS | 9392 | 9292 | `/api/sts` |
| Status List | 9999 | 9999 | `/statuslist` |

### SQL profile – infrastructure

| Service | Host port | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Configurable via `POSTGRES_PORT` in `.env` |
| HashiCorp Vault | 8200 | Configurable via `VAULT_PORT` in `.env` |

---

## Quick health check

The runtimes expose a JSON health endpoint on the default API port. A healthy response
returns `"isSystemHealthy":true`; the `sql` profile additionally reports the `Hashicorp
Vault Health` component.

```shell
# identityhub  (both profiles)
curl http://localhost:8181/api/check/health

# issuerservice  (both profiles)
curl http://localhost:8182/api/check/health
```

Example output (SQL profile):

```json
{"componentResults":[{"failure":null,"component":"Hashicorp Vault Health","isHealthy":true},{"failure":null,"component":"BaseRuntime","isHealthy":true}],"isSystemHealthy":true}
```

---

## Stopping and cleaning up

```shell
# Stop and remove containers (keep volumes)
docker compose --profile memory down
# or
docker compose --profile sql down

# Remove containers AND the postgres volume (full reset)
docker compose --profile sql down -v
```

---

## Configuration

The `config/` subdirectory contains per-runtime `configuration.properties` files that are
mounted read-only into the containers at `/app/configuration.properties`:

```
config/
  identityhub/configuration.properties        # SQL variant – full config with vault + datasource URLs
  identityhub-memory/configuration.properties # memory variant – full config, no vault/DB settings
  issuerservice/configuration.properties      # SQL variant – full config with vault + datasource URLs
  issuerservice-memory/configuration.properties # memory variant – full config, no vault/DB settings
```

> **Important:** EDC's `-Dedc.fs.config` mechanism loads **only** the external file; it does
> not merge with the `application.properties` bundled in the JAR. Each `configuration.properties`
> here is therefore self-contained and mirrors the corresponding
> `runtimes/*/src/main/resources/application.properties`, with the SQL variants also having
> all datasource URLs and the Vault URL set to the compose service hostnames.

### Customising credentials

Edit `.env` or set environment variables before running `docker compose`. The available
variables are documented in `.env.example`.

### DID resolution over HTTP vs HTTPS

The `edc.iam.did.web.use.https` setting controls how `did:web` DIDs are resolved:

| Value | Resolves `did:web:host%3Aport:path` via | Use for |
|-------|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `true` (default) | `https://host:port/path/did.json` | **Production** — DID documents are served over TLS |
| `false` | `http://host:port/path/did.json` | **Local docker / dev** — inter-container traffic is plain HTTP |

The bundled configs here do **not** set this key, so it defaults to `true`. The flows this
setup primarily demonstrates (health checks, super-user seeding) never resolve a `did:web`
DID, so they work as-is.

A full **DCP credential-exchange flow** between the bundled runtimes (e.g. the issuerservice
resolving a holder's `did:web` document over the compose network) *does* trigger resolution.
Because containers reach each other over plain HTTP (`http://issuerservice:10100/...`), the
default HTTPS resolver fails with `Unsupported or unrecognized SSL message`. To exercise such
flows locally, add the following to the relevant `config/*/configuration.properties` before
starting the stack:

```properties
# Local docker only — inter-container did:web endpoints are plain HTTP.
edc.iam.did.web.use.https=false
```

> **Security:** Never set `edc.iam.did.web.use.https=false` in production. A DID document
> fetched over plain HTTP can be tampered with in transit, undermining the trust anchor of
> the whole credential exchange. Production deployments must serve DIDs over HTTPS and leave
> this setting at its `true` default.

## Notes

- **HashiCorp Vault runs in dev mode** — data is stored in memory and lost on container
  restart. This is intentional for local development. Never use dev mode in production.
- **Flyway migrations run automatically** at startup for the SQL variants; no manual
  schema initialisation is required beyond the database creation performed by
  `postgres/init/01-create-databases.sh`. Each store maintains its own
  `flyway_schema_history_<store>` table in the target database.
- The `OTEL_JAR` build argument required by the existing Dockerfiles is satisfied by
  the OpenTelemetry agent downloaded to `build/resources/otel/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar`
  during the Gradle build. The javaagent line in the `ENTRYPOINT` is commented out by
  default, so it is copied into the image but not activated at runtime.
