## Required Knowledge

To effectively work with this project, familiarity with the following technologies is recommended:

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for deploying and managing the applications
- **Minikube**: Local Kubernetes environment for development and testing
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes, used for deploying the charts
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for persistent storage
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Secrets management system for secure credential storage

## Best Practices

- Use the official Helm charts for all deployments
- Follow the [Installation Guide](../INSTALL.md) for local development setup
- Test API endpoints using the provided Postman or Bruno collections

> [!NOTE]
> When testing, it is recommended to enable ingress to avoid working with port-forwarding. Refer to the respective chart documentation for ingress configuration options, including hostname, TLS settings, and annotations.
